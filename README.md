# SIMFEX
We provide a tool for the simulation-free extrapolation method for misspecified models with errors-in-variables.
## Usage
You first need to load "functions.R" and install R package "MASS". We describe the data generation and how to conduct pseudo-simulation extrapolation method for given dataset in "main.R". After running the "main.R", you can obtain the point estimator, variance estimator and $p$-value of the pseudo-SIMEX method.
