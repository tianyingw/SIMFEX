# SIMFEX
An R tool for the simulation-free extrapolation method for misspecified models with errors-in-variables.
## Usage
You first need to install R packages "MASS" and "simex", and then load "functions.R". We describe the data generation and how to conduct simulation-free extrapolation method for given dataset in "main.R". After running the "main.R", you can obtain the point estimator, variance estimator and $p$-value of the SIMFEX method.
